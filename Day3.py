# In the Day3 I'm Learning About the Introduction to  Variables and DataTypes in Python

# We Simply Declare the variable using = operator
a = 1
print(a)

b= 'Akshay'
print(b)

c = True
print(c)

# To check The Datatype of the variable we can use type() function
print("The Type of a", type(a))
print("The Type of b", type(b))
print("The Type of c", type(c))

#Sequence Datatypes: list, tuple , Dict

list1 = [8,2.38, "Hello", [5,-4], ["apple","Banana"]]
print(list1)

tuple1 = ("Apple" , 8, -5,"banana")
print(tuple1)

dict1= {"Name":"Akshay","Age":21,"canVote":True}
print(dict1)
